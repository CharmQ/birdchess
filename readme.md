# Bird Chess

<p class="text-justify">
Bird Chess is the title of a basic project zulfarZUK1693 and I have created to practice our python skills - or lackthereof. Chess became a common interest to both of us for several years now, perhaps even longer for zulfarZUK himself, and we were throwing around the idea of starting a project together. zulfarZUK's experience with projects have so far been unsatisfactory so far... to say the least. Everytime he brings up the idea of starting a project with another person, that person promptly disappears, as if spirited away by some unknown force in the ether. I suppose zulfarZUK has that kind of effect on people. Perhaps this project may prove to be different, but if you don't hear from me after a while, then I too have fallen victim to this unknown force.

## Objective

<p class="text-justify">
The goal of Bird Chess is to successfully implement the following features:

1. Create a standard 8x8 chess board with pieces; and
2. Establish the standard rules of the game; and
3. Create an AI that the user can play against that plays legal moves.
</p>

**Bonus**
<p class="text-justify">
The bonus objective is to create an AI that plays the bird opening as white, which incidentally is the name of this project.
